# new_lib

A base ruby lib project with some dependencies installed and configured to ease the development.
The idea is to have a skeleton for new projects and keep the tech stack up to date.

## TODO:

* Install and configure simple-cov and other metric gems
* Try to incorporate metrics into guard or git-hooks

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version
* System dependencies
* Configuration
* Database creation
* Database initialization
* How to run the test suite
* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)
* Deployment instructions
* ...
